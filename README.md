## Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
This project demonstrates basic web development skills and game logic implementation.  
The game allows two players to take turns marking cells in a 3x3 grid until one player achieves three in a row, column, or diagonal, or the game results in a draw.



### Technologies Used
- HTML for the game structure
- CSS for styling and layout
- JavaScript for game logic

### How to Play
1. Open the game in a web browser.  
2. Click on any cell to make a move.  
3. The game alternates between "X" and "O" players.  
4. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.  
5. If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.  
6. Click the "Restart" button to start a new game.
